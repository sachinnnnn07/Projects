Virus Total API
🛡️ Want to Scan Files & URLs for Malware Using VirusTotal API? In this Project, I have build build a powerful web tool using HTML, CSS & JavaScript to interact with the VirusTotal API and check for threats in real-time! 💻🦠

🔥 What I built

- A modern, responsive front-end that accepts file uploads and URL input.
- Integration with the VirusTotal API to submit and retrieve scan reports.
- Friendly UI feedback (progress, results, error handling).
- Basic rate-limit aware handling and user guidance for API limits.
- Optional EmailJS integration to send alerts/notifications (requires your own keys).

Warning
You need to get your own EmailJS Keys

// API key from VirusTotal API
const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
